<strong>3. A1) Existing System</strong>

•	At present, if a person wants to buy coffee beans or the things/appliances needed for making a coffee, He/she would buy the local coffee brands from their local areas shops. If really he/she a true coffee lover then he/she would order it online from any e-commerce website which everyone knows doesn't provide us with affordable prices, well known brands and convenient free delivery either. <br>
•	No proper management of information is seen as Data and useful application details are capped in physical file, which itself are stored in a record room. <br>
•	Also, if a person visits any store for buying vending machine or any appliances needed for coffee making, they really aren't that affordable as there are many third person involved before the thing is delivered to the retail shop owner and thus it obvious, the price of anything will be higher than it was before. <br>
•	Buying Coffee Beans by going physically can me more than time consuming, as there are 4 main types and many subtypes included and every type has its own unique taste <br>
•	Cafe owners are not able to manage the payment part and could not analyze the 'most selling beans' efficiently and thus will not be able to update his/her market strategy according the recent trends. <br>
