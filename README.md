•	Almost 80% of the population are coffee lovers. <br>
•	Coffee Shop Management System consists following modules such as; Login Module, Employee Module, Administrator Module. <br>

<br>

<strong>2.	Objective</strong>

•	To make our business digitally known to the world <br>
•	To provide our customers the most aromatic and exotic coffee beans on their fingertips. <br>

<br>

<strong>3. A1) Existing System</strong>

•	At present, if a person wants to buy coffee beans or the things/appliances needed for making a coffee, He/she would buy the local coffee brands from their local areas shops. If really he/she a true coffee lover then he/she would order it online from any e-commerce website which everyone knows doesn't provide us with affordable prices, well known brands and convenient free delivery either. <br>
•	No proper management of information is seen as Data and useful application details are capped in physical file, which itself are stored in a record room. <br>
•	Also, if a person visits any store for buying vending machine or any appliances needed for coffee making, they really aren't that affordable as there are many third person involved before the thing is delivered to the retail shop owner and thus it obvious, the price of anything will be higher than it was before. <br>
•	Buying Coffee Beans by going physically can me more than time consuming, as there are 4 main types and many subtypes included and every type has its own unique taste <br>
•	Cafe owners are not able to manage the payment part and could not analyze the 'most selling beans' efficiently and thus will not be able to update his/her market strategy according the recent trends. <br>

<br>

<b>3.	A2) Limitations of Existing System: -</b>

•	The institute doesn't have any software application which maintains data of the employees. <br>
•	The record keeping is done manually. This leads to great difficulty when certain needs arrive of looking into employees' past data. <br>
•	The institute uses a Coffee Shop Management application which has limited features and doesn't work efficiently and effectively. It doesn't fulfill many requirement of the administrative department. <br>
•	The manual system can have problems with paper-based work. <br>
•	No proper management of information is seen as Data and useful application details are capped in physical file, which itself are stored in a record room. <br>
•	Buying Coffee Beans by going physically can me more than time consuming, as there are 4 main types and many subtypes included and every type has its own unique taste <br>

<br>

<b>3.	B1) Proposed System: -</b>

•	This being a Desktop-based application is very easy to access. <br>
•	Data and records are managed in centralized database. <br>
•	If a person wants to buys coffee beans or the appliances needed for making coffee all over the world, it would on their fingertip <br>
•	No third person involvement as retail shopkeeper as it a Wholesale Online Market <br>
•	Computer Based Software guarantees you No miscalculations from the system end. <br> 
•	The employee information handling and time sheet management is the responsibility of the administrator. <br>
•	This system itself updates based on whatever is required or requested from the user end. <br>

<br>

<b>3.	B2) Advantages of Proposed System over the Existing System: -</b>

The online shopping system covers the various issues. These are as follows: - <br>
•	Data is secure and easy to retrieve, store, and analyze, so chances of miscalculations and occurrence of error are very less.<br>
•	In existing traditional and manual system, the chances of error occurrence would be very high, but this being an online computerized application, gives users alert messages, helps, and warnings on whatever required or requested.<br>
•	It saves times for customer. <br>
•	It is convenient way of shopping.<br>
•	It is available 24x7 manners.<br>
•	It is true that human made mistakes as a computer are always accurate.<br>
•	There is a separate database records stored in a hard disk.<br>
•	It provides most secured way for shopping. <br>
•	Easy to generate daily sales reports.<br>
•	Easy to check the available stock of products. <br>
•	User friendly GUI.<br>
